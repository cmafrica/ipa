This page is designed to be a convenient tool for linguists and linguistics students.<br />
I first noticed the serious lack of an organized, central resource for the entire IPA in<br />
Introduction to Linguistics, but it became much more apparent during Phonetics & Phonemics.<br />
The main goal of this project was to use data mining to amass and organize a comprehensive<br />
IPA database; all of the information exists online already, but it's scattered and not easily<br />
combined. While this is only somewhat accomplished here so far, visualization of this information<br />
is much more useful to others. I hope that you find this tool as useful as I would have found<br />
it in my previous classes.<br />
<br />
Please <a href="mailto:mam315@pitt.edu">email me</a> if you have any ideas, or if you come across an error or bug in the program.<br />
This is still in Beta testing, and I am relying on your input to help make this tool as comprehensive,<br />
useful and user-friendly as possible.<br />
